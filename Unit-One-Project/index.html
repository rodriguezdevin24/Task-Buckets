            <h1>Welcome to Task Buckets!!</h1>
            Welcome to the task tracking game Task Buckets! The purpose of this game is designed to help you
            keep track of your tasks in a fun and interactive way. With this
            game, you'll be able to easily manage your tasks and increase your

            <h1>How to Play</h1>
            The game is very simple to play. To get started, lets show you around:


            <h3>Tasks Button</h3>
            The Task button is located at the center of the screen directly below 
            the backboard. When pressed, the Task button will have a few functionalities. 
            You will be able to see what tasks you have to do for the day and what number 
            they are assigned to. Remember the number!! You will need it to shoot the ball
            into the basket. You can also enter a task and press the add button and the 
            corresponding task and number will show up. You can also remove your tasks by 
            pressing rseet!
            

            <h3>Submit Button</h3>
            Once you have accomplished the task, enter the number in the prompt box! Press the 
            shoot! button and your task will be tracked! Please remember to enter a valid task number!


            <h3>Stats Button</h3>
            Once you've completed a task, click on the "Stat" button
            next to the task in the list. This will mark down the task number accomplished 
            and you can refer back to the Task button see what tasks you did! Furthermore,
            when the next day button is pressed, all the tasks accomplished will be cleared!
           

            <h3>Next Day Button</h3>
            Once you are complete for the day, or the day is over, whichever comes first,
            you press the next day button. You are your biggest oppponent. So when the 
            next day button is pressed, not only is all the information cleared from the stat
            tab, but the home score updates to 0 and the opponents score updates to the score 
            from the day before. The purpose of each day is to try to defeat yourself from the 
            day before!
           

            <h3>Reset the Game</h3>
            If you want to start over, click on the "next day" button twice. The first time 
            will move the score from the home to the opponents side, and the second time will
            clear the scoreboard to 0!
            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
