# Task Buckets!

## Project Description 

The game that I would like to create for my Unit 1 Assignment is a game called King of the Task Court. The game is designed to help you keep track of your daily tasks. The game is designed to resemble a basketball scoreboard to keep track of the tasks you accomplish. I want to have somewhere that has a layout of the tasks when you click on it, and when you input the number of the task, it adds one, two, or three points. I want it to be able to tell you the score at the end and each day you can vs yourself from the day before and try to score the same or more points.
